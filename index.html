                        high-quality training workshops for teams, leaders, and staff, and expert coaching services.
                        Known
                        as a
                        systems-builder and a connector of people, Sonya brings new life to each project she takes
                        on,
                        and
                        takes
                        a values-based approach at every turn.</p>
                    <p> Prior to launching her own consulting firm, Sonya was an educational consultant and devoted
                        elementary
                        educator with experience teaching grades TK-2, coaching teachers at each stage of
                        development,
                        and
                        facilitating high-quality trainings and workshops. She taught at a public charter school in
                        the

                        Francisco Bay Area, where she refined her expertise as a coach and facilitator with an
                        emphasis
                        on
                        Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (D.E.I.), data-driven instruction, and early literacy
                        development.
                        Sonya began teaching as a Teach For America corps member in New Mexico, where she taught
                        indigenous
                        elementary students at a public school on the Navajo Nation. Her work is also grounded in
                        her
                        background
                        as an education advocate for institutions of higher education in California. Sonya is a
                        passionate
                        advocate for educational equity in underserved and underrepresented communities.

                    <p>Sonya earned her master’s in Elementary Education from the University of New Mexico. She holds a
                        bachelor’s degree in Communication Studies from San Francisco State University. Outside of her
                        work
                        in
                        schools and classrooms, Sonya enjoys a number of creative endeavors. She takes classes in
                        singing
                        and in
                        Spanish, makes time to play her ukulele, and seeks opportunities to take the perfect photo.
                        Sonya
                        finds
                        inspiration in nature, and can usually be found exploring the many hiking trails and campgrounds
                        in
                        her
                        California community.</p>
