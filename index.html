                        Known
                        as a
                        systems-builder and a connector of people, Sonya brings new life to each
                        project she takes
                        on,
                        and
                        takes
                        a values-based approach at every turn.</p>
                    <p> Prior to launching her own consulting firm, Sonya was an educational
                        consultant and devoted
                        elementary
                        educator with experience teaching grades TK-2, coaching teachers at each

                        development,
                        and
                        facilitating high-quality trainings and workshops. She taught at a public
                        charter school in
                        the
                        San
                        Francisco Bay Area, where she refined her expertise as a coach and
                        facilitator with an
                        emphasis
                        on
                        Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (D.E.I.), data-driven instruction, and
                        early literacy
                        development.
                        Sonya began teaching as a Teach For America corps member in New Mexico,
                        where she taught
                        indigenous
                        elementary students at a public school on the Navajo Nation. Her work is
                        also grounded in
                        her
                        background
                        as an education advocate for institutions of higher education in California.
                        Sonya is a
                        passionate
                        advocate for educational equity in underserved and underrepresented
                        communities.
